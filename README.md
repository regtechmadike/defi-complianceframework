# DeFi Compliance Framework

**Bridging Traditional AML/CFT with Decentralized Finance Innovation**  

A practical, open-source framework for evaluating regulatory compliance risks in DeFi protocols and designing "compliant-by-design" solutions.  

Created by **Magdalene Madike** — Blockchain Compliance Specialist | RegTech Automator | ISO 27001:2022 Lead Auditor (97%) | Self-taught Ethereum/Solidity Developer | 6.5+ years AML/KYC/FICA operations.

### Why This Matters (2026 Context)
DeFi protocols (e.g., AMMs like Uniswap) drive permissionless finance but face growing AML/CFT scrutiny. Key insights from FATF's 2025 Targeted Update on Virtual Assets/VASPs:
- Many "decentralised" arrangements are centralised in practice (control by creators/operators/front-ends).
- Challenges identifying VASPs in DeFi (e.g., who has "sufficient influence"?).
- FATF plans targeted papers on DeFi (Oct 2025–Jun 2026), focusing on risks, typologies, and good practices.
- Emphasis on risk-based approach (RBA), Travel Rule hurdles in non-custodial setups, and offshore VASP mitigation.

This framework applies real-world compliance (transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, KYC/CDD) to DeFi — helping protocols, auditors, regulators, and institutions mitigate risks while preserving innovation.

### Core Files in This Repo
- **FRAMEWORK.md** → Step-by-step methodology (risk ID → mitigation → monitoring).
- **regulatory-mapping.md** → FATF Rec 15/INR.15 mapped to DeFi elements (2025/2026 updates).
- **uniswap-analysis.md** → Case study: Uniswap V4 hooks for on-chain compliance (KYC/AML checks, sanctions oracles).
- **risk-scoring.py** → Python script for quick protocol risk assessment.
- **compliance-checklist.csv** → Audit template (FATF applicability, controls, evidence).

### Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/Nobody3120/defi-compliance-framework.git`
2. Explore the docs and run the script (setup coming soon).
3. Use for: Protocol audits, DeFi integration risk eval, or compliance proposals.

### My Unique Value
Fluent in Solidity/regulations — inspired by my projects achieving 60% efficiency in AML automation and 75% cyber risk reduction. This repo demonstrates compliant-by-design thinking for FinTech, banking, and Web3 roles.
